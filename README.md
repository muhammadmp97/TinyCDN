TinyCDN is a simple Content Delivery Network (CDN) service implemented in Go. It supports caching with Redis, response compression with gzip, and includes monitoring integration with Prometheus.

## Features
- HTTP server with routing via [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- Caching layer backed by Redis for fast content delivery
- Gzip compression to reduce bandwidth usage
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/muhammadmp97/TinyCDN.git
cd TinyCDN
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

## Contributing
I started this project to get hands-on experience with Go and to learn how to cache and serve static files. Iâ€™d love to see contributions from others!

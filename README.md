TinyCDN is a simple Content Delivery Network (CDN) service implemented in Go. It supports caching with Redis, response compression with gzip, and includes monitoring integration with Prometheus.

## Features
- HTTP server with routing via [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- Large files are stored externally on MinIO object storage
- Caching layer backed by Redis for fast content delivery
- Gzip compression to reduce bandwidth usage
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/muhammadmp97/TinyCDN.git
cd TinyCDN
cp .env.example .env
./tinycdn.sh up
curl -v http://localhost:8080/g/code.jquery.com?file=jquery-migrate-3.5.2.min.js
curl -v http://localhost:8080/g/images.pexels.com?file=photos/33060985/pexels-photo-33060985.jpeg
```

## What I learned
- Deepened knowledge of Go, including contexts, error handling, and internal packages.
- Used xxHash for generating redis keys, leveraging its extremely fast and efficient hashing performance.
- Gained practical experience with gzip compression, understanding the trade-offs between server CPU load and client bandwidth savings.
- Learned how to configure and work with MinIO and its policies. Discovered the advantages of its S3 compatibility, making it a convenient choice for development.
- Learned a bit about Docker best practices and corrected mistakes, such as avoiding copying the .env file into the image.
- Learned about [Redis key eviction policies](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/eviction/#eviction-policies) and selected `allkeys-lru` based on the system requirements. This ensures that if a key without TTL is ever added, it can still be evicted, unlike `volatile-lru`, which only applies to keys that have the expire field set to true.
- Discovered the [Viper package](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and used it to improve configuration management.
- Wrote a Bash script for the first time to simplify the build, run, and configuration processes.

## Contributing
I started this project to get hands-on experience with Go and to learn how to cache and serve static files. Iâ€™d love to see contributions from others!
